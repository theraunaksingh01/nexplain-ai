# NExplain

NExplain is a simple, focused platform for **clear, structured technical notes**.

This project was created to solve a personal problem:  
many popular learning sites provide *too much information*, making it hard for beginners to understand core concepts clearly and quickly.

NExplain focuses on:
- Simplicity
- Concept-first explanations
- Minimal but sufficient theory

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

While learning computer science topics, I often found that:
- Notes were scattered
- Explanations were verbose or confusing
- Core ideas were buried under unnecessary details

NExplain was built as an attempt to create:
- Clean, readable notes
- Beginner-friendly explanations
- Well-structured topic breakdowns

This repository represents the **notes-first foundation** of that idea.
