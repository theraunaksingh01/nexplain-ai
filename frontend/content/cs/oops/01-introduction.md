# Object Oriented Programming (OOPS)

## What is OOPS?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) is a programming paradigm where software is designed using **objects** that represent real-world entities.

Each object:
- Stores data (state)
- Performs actions (behavior)

---

## Intuition

Instead of writing programs as a long list of instructions, OOPS encourages thinking in terms of **things** and how they interact.

Example:
- A `Car` object has color and speed
- A `User` object has name and email

---

## Why OOPS Matters

- Makes large programs easier to understand
- Improves code reuse
- Models real-world problems naturally
- Widely used in modern software systems

## Languages Using OOPS

- Java
- Python
- C++
- C#
- JavaScript (object-based)
