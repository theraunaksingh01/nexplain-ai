📘 NExplain — Structured Notes for Core CS Concepts

NExplain is a clean, structured notes platform built to make core computer science concepts clear, concise, and beginner-friendly.

This project was created to solve a personal learning problem:
while studying CS fundamentals, existing resources often felt verbose, fragmented, or unclear, especially for first-time learners. NExplain focuses on point-wise explanations, intuition, and clarity.

✨ What This Project Does Well

📚 Structured Notes
Clear, markdown-based notes for core topics (currently OOPS).

🧭 Logical Flow
Each topic is broken down into:

Definition

Intuition

Why it matters

Key points

Simple examples

📈 Progress Tracking (Prototype)
Tracks reading progress at topic and subtopic level.

🧠 Focused Learning Experience
No distractions, no clutter — just concepts explained cleanly.

📂 Current Topics

Computer Science

Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)

Introduction

Classes & Objects

Inheritance

Polymorphism

(Notes are written and maintained in Markdown for simplicity.)

🛠 Tech Stack

Next.js (App Router)

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

PostgreSQL

Markdown-based content

NextAuth (prototype authentication)

🎯 Project Status

This project is complete and archived.

While the original idea explored advanced features like AI assistance and analytics, this repository is intentionally finalized as a clean notes platform and learning artifact.

Future work, if any, will happen in separate repositories with a different problem focus.

📌 Why This Project Exists

To practice building a full-stack learning platform

To experiment with content structuring and UX for education

To document a real product iteration journey — including deciding when not to continue

🧠 Key Takeaway

Not every good project needs to become a startup.
Some projects exist to sharpen thinking, taste, and judgment.
