### definition

A class is a blueprint that defines data and behavior for objects. It groups related fields and methods in a single unit. Memory for its members is allocated only when an object is created.

Acts as a template to create objects with shared structure.
Does not occupy memory for fields until instantiation.
Can contain fields, methods, constructors, nested classes and interfaces.
