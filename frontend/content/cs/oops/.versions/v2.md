### example

class Student {
    int id;
    String n;

    public Student(int id, String n) {
        this.id = id;
        this.n = n;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student(10, "Alice");
        System.out.println(s1.id);
        System.out.println(s1.n);
    }
}

### definition

A class is a blueprint that defines data and behavior for objects. It groups related fields and methods in a single unit. Memory for its members is allocated only when an object is created.

Acts as a template to create objects with shared structure.
Does not occupy memory for fields until instantiation.
Can contain fields, methods, constructors, nested classes and interfaces.

### clarification

In Java, classes and objects form the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They help model real-world entities and organize code in a structured way.

A class is a blueprint used to create objects that share common properties and behavior.
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity created from the class template.
For Example, Dog is a class, Tommy is an object of that class.
