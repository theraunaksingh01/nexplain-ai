# Inheritance

## Definition
Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and behaviors of another class.

## Intuition
Think of inheritance like a child inheriting traits from parents.

## Why it matters
- Promotes code reuse
- Enables polymorphism
- Improves maintainability

## Example (Java)

```java
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}
